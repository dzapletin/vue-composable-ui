# Getting Started

## Introduction

Headless or not, there is just no way to create a one-size-fits-all UI framework. With any framework you always end up one component short, always have to reinvent the wheel at some point and always have to compromise.

The idea of Vue Composable UI is to abstract functionality, not components. This way you do not have to adopt any kind of opinionated UI paradigm and do not have to recreate basic UI functionaly for application-specific components that are not present in frameworks.

### So, what is the Components section about?

Basically it is just a demo of the composables above, heavily influenced by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/). You can use the components as is or modify to your own needs.

## Installation

To get started, install Vue Composable UI via npm:

```sh
npm install vue-composable-ui
```

And import required composables or components:

```ts
import { useList } from "vue-composable-ui";
```
